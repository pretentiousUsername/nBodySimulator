# Stuff I need to work on
+ Make `outOfBounds` deflect particles *before* they get stuck out of bounds;
  look into making a periodic system too. (I'll need to factor in the time
  resolution $\delta t$.)
+ ~~Make a more robust integrator that uses functions and the like, rather than
  a bunch of nested loops and if statementsâ€”I really wouldn't recommend you look
  at [`integrator.jl`](src/integrator.jl) if you value your sanity.~~
+ ~~Make an easier way to set up a simulation with various potentials.~~
+ Consider changing the `positionStep` and `momentumStep` functions to use
  a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, rather than a simple finite difference
  scheme.
+ Add in functionality for defining custom simulations rather than making a
  random list of particles.
